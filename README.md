# 11.-ML-PUZZLE-SOLVING-PYTHON

In the book "An introduction To Machine Learning" by Miroslav Kubat, the first chapter explains the process of the Hill Climbing method to resolve puzzles.

I apply this method to solve the problem in the book. For that, I create the problem itself in a "matrix" form, then I create the ways a tile moves.
After that, I create an algorithm to predict which option should the computer take and then move the tile.
This is all in a loop that has a memory in order to break infinite loops in the code.
